## Challenge
Given an n x n Chess board, fit in n - 1 queens on the board such that they do not intersect or threaten each other.

Store the arrangements in a multidimensional array.

Print out the result assuming the board's rows are traversed from top to bottom(0 to n-1) and the board's columns are traversed from left to right(0 to n-1).

The arrangement implies that the top left square(first square) of the board has an index of **0,0**.

This question does not need a web program. A console program is recommended.

You are free to make use of any programming language of your choice.

#### Hints
- n must not be less than 2.
- Avoid nested loops as performance may be greatly affected for higher values of n.
